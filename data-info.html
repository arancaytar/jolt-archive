    <h1><a href="/jolt">NationStates Jolt Archive</a></h1>
    <p>
      This archive contains forum content published between 2002 - 2009 by participants in the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationStates">NationStates</a> online game. The forum
      was hosted by the now-defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolt_Online_Gaming">Jolt Online Gaming</a>
      company, until it was closed in 2009. This archive was created in February 2010, at a time when the forum was
      online in a read-only state, and then published late 2013, after Jolt Online Gaming was closed and its
      website shut down.
